# Welcome to utils-cli! 

At utils-cli, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with graphics toolkit with WebGL, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[sass](https://github.com/utils-cli/sass)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast sass library. âœ¨

Beyond sass, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* models optimization
* package-lock.json integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
